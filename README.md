# Deep Learning
This is a repository to learn Deep Learning from Course: [Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/) on Udemy. The main purpose of this repository is to have a reference of the course practiced by myself on Github (and if possible some modifications) for later point of time.

## Artificial Neural Network:
An artificial neural network (ANN) is the piece of a computing system designed to simulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes information. It is the foundation of artificial intelligence (AI) and solves problems that would prove impossible or difficult by human or statistical standards. ANNs have self-learning capabilities that enable them to produce better results as more data becomes available.

A well defined structure of ANN looks like:
